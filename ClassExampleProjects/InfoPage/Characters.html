				<p>Harry James Potter was born on July 31st to James and Lily Potter. Known in his youthful years as "The Boy Who Lived", Harry
				was the only known survivor of the killing curse. No surprise to those who know his past Harry excels in the area of Defense Against
				the Dark Arts. During his third year at school he is able to perform a complicated piece of magic that some full-grown wizards are 
				unable to produce. However, instead of him becoming cocky, and boasting of his accomplishments he is always quick to mention the help
				he has received from others. His two closest friends are Hermione and Ron, and their friendship was formed through defeating a mountain
				troll together in the middle of their first year at school.</p>
				
				<h1 id="hermione">Hermione Jean Granger</h1>
				<a href="https://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/4/41/Hermionedhface.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20161221044857">

				<p>Hermione Jean Granger was born on September 19th to Mr. and Mrs. Granger (Their names are not provided in the series). 
				Very little is known about Hermione's family and early childhood years. </p>
				<h3>Things we do know are:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Both of Hermione's parents are dentists</li>
					<li>Hermione has a good relationship with her parents</li>
					<li>Hermione is used to not having a lot of friends</li>
					<li>Hermione is able to easily recall information that she has heard, seen, or read.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Although readers lack knowledge about Hermione outside of the wizarding world, there is more than enough information about her 
				from the wizarding world to make her an ideal role model. Without Hermione's aid in all of the books, Harry would not have been able
				to achieve all that he did. Hermione was an un-wavering friend to Harry. At all times she was willing to help him, no matter how
				dangerous the task ahead was.</p>
				
				<h1 id="ron">Ronald Bilius Weasley</h1>
				<a href="https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/8/85/Ron_Weasley.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20150828153318">
				<img src="https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/8/85/Ron_Weasley.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20150828153318" height="500"></a>
				<p>Ronald Bilius Weasley was born on March 1st to Arthur and Molly Weasley. Ron is the 6th out of 7 children. Ron has five older brothers.
				In age order they are: Bill, Charlie, Percy, Fred, and George. Ron also has a sister, Ginny, who is one year younger than him. Ron often
				struggles with jealousy, both of his brothers and of his best friend - Harry. When he looks into the Mirror of Erisde (or Mirror of Desire)
				he sees himself, standing alone and surpassing all the achievments of his brothers.</p>

				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I grew up in Exeter Township, and still live there. 
				I am a middle school computer science teacher in Lancaster County.</p>
				<p>I have always loved helping others. I started tutoring in 10th grade. 
				I began by tutoring other students in my school, through the guidance office, who were struggling in math.</p>
				<p>Since then, I have helped a number of different people. Some of the people 
				I have met with have been one time meetings, while others take place on a regular basis.</p>
				<p>In college I had the opportunity to tutor elementary students in an after school program. 
				I also worked with two high school students on a weekly basis, by recommendation of the faculty. </p>
				<p>Since graduating in 2015, I have helped adults to gain computer skills and confidence with new 
				technology, I have taught multiple summer camps, and I have continued to tutor high school students 
				in different areas of mathematics.</p>

				<h2>Testimonials</h2>
				<p>"Erin taught me in 3 weeks what I couldn't learn in a year" - Gabe</p>
				<p>"Erin really helped me with my math class by breaking down the math problems and 
				going over them with me again and again until I finally understood them. 
				The next test I received a 100% and I could not have done it without her patience with me

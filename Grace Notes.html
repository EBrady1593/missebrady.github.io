<h1>Grace Notes Big Band</h1>
<p><strong>MISSON STATEMENT</strong>. </p>
<ul>
<li>The Grace Notes Gospel Big Band is a group of musicians and singers from all areas and denominations 
of the Lehigh Valley dedicated to spreading God's word through instrument and voice to God's people and 
those needing encouragement. Since the fall of 2000, our mission has been to WITNESS, WORSHIP and ENCOURAGE 
with the gifts God has given us. </li>
<li>We  combine standard hymn favorites and today's praise and worship music into the sound of the Big Bands 
and of contemporary instrumental and vocal gospel music. </li>
<li>The Grace Notes consists of 20 musicians and 4 singers with special emphasis on brass and rhythm. 
This unique format is the first of its kind in the Lehigh Valley and can be enjoyed by all ages. </li>
<li>The Grace Notes is pleased to play concerts at outreach ministries, 
Bible camps such as Waldheim Camp and Milford Park Camp, Church banquets, 
Special church afternoon and evening services, (sorry, we are not able to do Sun. morning services) 
and senior citizens facilities.</li>
<li>There is no set fee for the Grace Notes to perform, we only request a free will offering.
This allows us to play small churches and senior centers as well as large ones.</li>
<li>The Grace Notes have had the privilege of playing for recording artists Bruce Heffner, 
David O'Neill and The Instruments Of Praise (Cedar Crest Bible Fellowship Church). </li>
